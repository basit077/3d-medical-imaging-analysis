# Medical Image Segmentation with Deep Learning

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to my journey in exploring deep learning methods for medical image segmentation using both PyTorch and TensorFlow.

## Project Goals
- Implement and compare segmentation models using PyTorch and TensorFlow.
- Learn best practices in medical image preprocessing, augmentation, and evaluation.
- Document experiments, insights, and learning resources.
- Connect and collaborate with the medical imaging and AI community.

## Structure
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for experiments and tutorials.
- `src/` – Python scripts for models and utilities.
- `data/` – Placeholder for datasets (no sensitive data will be uploaded).
- `requirements.txt` – Dependencies for this project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/basit077/medical-image-segmentation-dl.git
    cd medical-image-segmentation-dl
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Explore the notebooks and code in `notebooks/` and `src/`.

## Learning and Collaboration
- If you work in medical imaging or deep learning, please feel free to connect!
- Open an Issue or start a Discussion to share ideas, ask questions, or suggest improvements.
